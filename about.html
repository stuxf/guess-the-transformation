      <h3 class="nes-text is-primary">What is the point of this game?</h3>
      <p>
        The point of this game is simple. You are given an image, and must try
        to guess the transformation that was applied to the image. There are
        multiple stages, with increasing difficulty, starting from simply
        guessing the type of transformation, to guessing the exact
        transformation matrix.
